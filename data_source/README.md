# Data Source
This subsystem simulates an external data source, such as the VA CDW "CDWWork" database.

## SQL Server Docker Image
This reference application interfaces with Microsoft SQL Server as the source data system. One option for standing up a SQL Server instance on a macOS based computer is to run a pre-configured Docker image provided by Microsoft. This image includes the Ubunto Open Source Linux operating system, which SQL Server runs on.
